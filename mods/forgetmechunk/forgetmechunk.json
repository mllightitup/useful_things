    "body": "# ForgetMeChunk\n\nForgetMeChunk is a simple client side mod that removes a type of light update when unloading chunks.\nThis fixes the large lag spikes you sometimes get when crossing a chunk border.\n\nIt is unlikely that this would cause any issues, however any issues it does cause would be client side only and fixed by reloading the affected chunks.\n\nHowever use at your own risk.\n\n## Demo\nDemo performed using Hermitcraft season 8 world download & Minecraft 1.18.1\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wee5Rct6b_k\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
