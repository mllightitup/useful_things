The fix will only prevent new glitches but will not repair already existing ones. If upgrading an already corrupted world to 0.7.2, you need to erase the light cache once, see the note on [MC-142134](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-142134) for complete instructions.\n\n### Change\n* Mark `Starlight` as incompatible. Having both `Phosphor` and `Starlight` installed will now lead to a crash instead of loading the game normally and causing unexpected logic errors later on. `Phosphor` and `Starlight` were always incompatible and will always be, as they reimplement the lighting engine to a certain extent, hence modifying the same code in conflicting ways. With this change the game simply shuts down gracefully instead of causing undefined behavior.\n",
