    "body": "## Warning\n\n**Krypton is a work-in-progress.** I do not provide any guarantees about its stability, compatibility with other mods, or support for every possible setup out there. Support for this mod is provided on a \"best-effort\" basis. This is not my day job, it is a hobby growing out of related work I've done.\n\n## Sponsor Me!\n\nDid this mod make your server playable? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## What's Krypton?\n\nKrypton (from Ancient Greek _kryptos_, \"the hidden one\") is a Fabric mod that attempts to optimize the Minecraft networking stack. It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have sen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium. Support beyond these mods is provided on a best effort basis.",
