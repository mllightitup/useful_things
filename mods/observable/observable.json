    "body": "A spiritual successor to LagGoggles for Minecraft 1.16+, Observable profiles (tile) entities and shows you what's taking up tick time and where. Forge and Fabric compatible. (Note: default keybind to open profiler GUI is r.)\n\nThis is in ridiculously early alpha. It seems to work with major modpacks (Fabric packs tested more often than Forge), but I won't guarantee anything. Also please report any bugs on the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/tasgon/observable/issues).\n\n**NOTE: I've been running into a few issues uploading files here, so if you're looking for the Forge version, go to the mod's [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/observable/) instead.**\n\nCurrent known issues:\n\n- Results screen is sometimes empty (closing and reopening the GUI fixes it)\n\nDependencies:\n\n- Forge: [Architectury API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-forge), [Kotlin for Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kotlin-for-forge)\n- Fabric: [Architectury API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-fabric), [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)\n",
