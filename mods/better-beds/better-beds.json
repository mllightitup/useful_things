    "body": "<center><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Removes the Block Entity Renderer from the bed and replaces it with the default minecraft model renderer. <br />This results in increased performance and resourcepack support!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(Completely clientside mod)<br /> <br />But where's the catch, you may ask. <br />Well, there is almost no catch, everything behaves the same as vanilla.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The only mod that's incompatible so far is Bedspreads, since that mod uses the block entity renderer of the bed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Also, mods that add custom beds using the default renderer need model files provided for them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Mods that add beds using a custom block entity renderer are untouched.<br /> <br />Why does the bed use a block entity renderer in the first place? <br />When beds were added in 1.12, the game was still using the old block id system, which only allowed for a limited amount of ids.<br />Because 1.12 added many new blocks, the game was running out of ids, so the developers made the bed a block entity + renderer to save ids.<br />In 1.13 (The Flattening) a new id system was introduced, allowing for an unlimited amount of ids, but the bed block entity and it's renderer weren't touched.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I iNstalLed tHiS mOD bUT iT LoOks tHE sAme aS VaNiLla!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">By default this pack includes models that perfectly mimic vanilla behavior, to change the look of the bed,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">install one of the example resource packs from <a href=\"https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/BetterBeds/releases/tag/v1.0.0-packs\">here</a> or create your own pack based on the examples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/rsTbTdf/betterbeds-banner.png\" width=\"768\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/t2dG0MP/2021-02-06-12-32-46.png\" width=\"655\" height=\"368\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://github.com/Motschen/Assets/blob/main/quilt+fabric-banner.png?raw=true\" alt=\"\" height=\"56\" /></p>",
