    "description": "Client mod to suppress campfire smoke when certain blocks are below the campfire.",
    "body": "This mod is for the [Fabric mod loader](https://www.fabricmc.net/) and [![minecraft versions](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/Minecraft_smoke-suppression_all.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smoke-suppression/files).\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod prevents campfires from creating any particles when certain blocks are underneath them. It affects both standard and soul campfires. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is to prevent client-side lag and general annoyance when using large numbers of campfires in farms. \n\n<br />\n\nThis is a client-side mod, it will have no effect if installed on a dedicated server.\n\n<br />\n\nThe default list of blocks that suppress smoke is:\n```json\n\"suppressing_blocks_list\": [\n  \"minecraft:hopper\",\n  \"minecraft:rail\",\n  \"minecraft:activator_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:powered_rail\",\n  \"minecraft:detector_rail\"\n]\n```\n\n<br />\n\nBlocks can be added and removed either using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing '.minecraft/config/smoke_suppression.json'\n\n<br />\n\nIf you'd like to translate Smoke Suppression (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/smoke-suppression/invite/). New translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod has three required dependencies, each must be installed for the mod to function:\n- [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886)\n- [Auto Config Updated API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/auto-config-updated-api/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886)\n- Fabric API:\n\n<br />\n\n[![Requires the Fabric API](https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files/all?filter-game-version=1738749986%3a70886)\n\n<br />\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it. \n\nI'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required. \n",
