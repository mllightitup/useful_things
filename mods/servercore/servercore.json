    "body": "# ServerCore\n\nA fabric mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server.\n\n#### This includes:\n\n- Several patches & optimizations to improve performance and reduce lagspikes, which shouldn't make any noticeable changes during gameplay.\n\n\n- Several configurable features that can heavily reduce lag, but have a slight impact on gameplay depending on the configuration.\n\n<br>\n\n### Warning\n>Some of the above optimizations use algorithms that may alter vanilla mechanics in the slightest.\\\n>These patches should all have an on/off switch in the config. If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n<br>\n\n## Features\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable and optional feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to\nbe processed on the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, with extra features.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\\\nThis allows for higher viewdistances at lower costs.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the MSPT and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance (1.18) & mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by slowing down the tick rate of villagers stuck\nin 1x1 spaces.\n\n<br>\n\n**- And more!**\n\n<br>\n\n## Commands & Configuration\n\n### Commands\n\n- /servercore - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current mobcaps, supports both per-player and global.\n\n- /sc status - Gives information about the current settings.\n\n##\n### Config\n\n<br>\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n```toml\n# Lets you enable / disable certain features and modify them.\n[features]\n\t# (Default = true) Stops the server from loading spawn chunks.\n\tdisable_spawn_chunks = true\n\t# (Default = true) Optimizes vanilla's per-player mobspawning by using PaperMC's PlayerMobDistanceMap.\n\tuse_distance_map = true\n\t# (Default = false) Allows xp orbs to merge with others that have different experience amounts.\n\t# This will also allow players to pickup xp much faster.\n\tfast_xp_merging = false\n\t# (Default = false) Makes villagers tick less often if they are stuck in a 1x1 space.\n\tlobotomize_villagers = false\n\t# (Default = 20) Decides the interval in between villager ticks when lobotomized.\n\tlobotomized_tick_interval = 20\n\t# (Default = 5) The amount of minutes in between auto-save intervals when /save-on is active.\n\tauto_save_interval = 5\n\t# (Default = 0.5) Decides the radius in blocks that items / xp will merge at.\n\titem_merge_radius = 0.5\n\txp_merge_radius = 0.5\n\n# Modifies mobcaps, no-chunk-tick, simulation and view-distance depending on the MSPT.\n[dynamic]\n\t# (Default = false) Enables this feature.\n\tenabled = false\n\t# (Default = 35) The average MSPT to target.\n\ttarget_mspt = 35\n\t# (Default = [Max: 10, Min: 2]) Distance in which random ticks and mobspawning can happen.\n\tmax_chunk_tick_distance = 10\n\tmin_chunk_tick_distance = 2\n\t# (Default = [Max: 10, Min: 2]) Distance in which the world will tick, similar to no-tick-vd.\n\tmax_simulation_distance = 10\n\tmin_simulation_distance = 2\n\t# (Default = [Max: 10, Min: 2]) Distance in which the world will render.\n\tmax_view_distance = 10\n\tmin_view_distance = 2\n\t# (Default = [Max: 1.0, Min: 0.3]) Global multiplier that decides the percentage of the mobcap to be used.\n\tmax_mobcap = 1.0\n\tmin_mobcap = 0.3\n\n# Stops animals / villagers from breeding if there are too many of the same type nearby.\n[entity_limits]\n\t# (Default = false) Enables this feature.\n\tenabled = false\n\t# (Default = [Villager: 24, Animals: 32]) Maximum count before stopping entities of the same type from breeding.\n\tvillager_count = 24\n\tanimal_count = 32\n\t# (Default = [Villager: 64, Animals: 64]) The range it will check for entities of the same type.\n\tvillager_range = 64\n\tanimal_range = 64\n\n# Allows you to disable specific commands and modify the way some of them are formatted.\n[commands]\n\t# Enables / disables the /mobcaps command.\n\tcommand_mobcaps = true\n\t# The title for the /mobcaps command.\n\tmobcap_title = \"§3Per Player Mobcaps (§a%MODIFIER%§3)\"\n\t# The content for the /mobcaps command.
