    "body": "# ServerCore\n\nA fabric mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server.\n\n#### This includes:\n\n- Several patches & optimizations to improve performance and reduce lagspikes, which shouldn't make any noticeable changes during gameplay.\n\n\n- Several configurable features that can heavily reduce lag, but have a slight impact on gameplay depending on the configuration.\n\n<br>\n\n### Warning\nSome of the above optimizations use algorithms that may alter vanilla mechanics in the slightest.\\\nThese patches should all have an on/off switch in the config. If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n<br>\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\nMost optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nBesides that, it also includes optimizations for chunk ticking, mob spawning, maps and player logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable and optional feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed on the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, with extra features.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\\\nThis allows for higher viewdistances at lower costs.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the MSPT and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance (1.18) & mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by slowing down the tick rate of villagers stuck\nin 1x1 spaces.\n\n<br>\n\n**- And more!**\n\n<br>\n\n## Commands & Configuration\n\n### Commands\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current settings.\n\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n##\n### Config\n\n<br>\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n```toml\n# Lets you enable / disable certain features and modify them.\n[features]\n\t# (Default = true) Optimizes vanilla's per-player mobspawning by using PaperMC's PlayerMobDistanceMap.\n\tuse_distance_map = true\n\t# (Default = false) Stops the server from loading spawn chunks.\n\tdisable_spawn_chunks = false\n\t# (Default = false) Allows more xp orbs to merge with one another, to reduce xp orb lag.\n\tfast_xp_merging = false\n\t# (Default = false) Prevents players from moving into unloaded chunks.\n\tprevent_moving_into_unloaded_chunks = false\n\t# (Default = 128) The radius at which the game will look for other portals.
