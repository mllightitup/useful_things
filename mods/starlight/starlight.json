    "body": "Starlight\n==================\nFabric mod for rewriting the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")",
