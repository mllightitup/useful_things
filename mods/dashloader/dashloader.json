    "body": "<center>\n\n## ![Information](https://quantumfusion.dev/assets/dashloader/features-new.png)\n<br>\nThis mod improves Minecraft client asset loading times about 6x by caching all of the game's content. This cache can be loaded in less than 2 seconds in most scenarios. The improvements are even bigger the more modded Minecraft is as it's highly efficient and scalable. Furthermore its 100% multithreaded so all of your cores will be active (Minecraft uses at most 2).\n<br><br>\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n&bull; The cache will be created on the first launch with DashLoader installed, making that one **significantly slower**. Actual acceleration only happens from the second launch onwards. The cache is also recreated every time you change something about your mods or resource packs, so if you do that often DashLoader is not for you.\n<br><br>\n&bull; Mod support is difficult to pin down. Most mods should work fine, but when they don't they are often horrifically broken with many models missing. Most of the incompatibilities are down to custom implementations of `BakedModel`. For basic information on how to add support, take a look at the wiki or ping !alpha in the discord.\n<br><br>\n&bull; If you use DashLoader in a development environment and change something about your mod's assets without incrementing the version, use F3+T ingame to reload resource packs. This will prompt Dash to recache and your new assets to show up.\n\n## ![Community](https://quantumfusion.dev/assets/dashloader/community-new.png)\n\n[![Discord](https://i.imgur.com/qbysL1T.png)](https://discord.gg/8F8MaYzk5h)\n\n## ![Sponsors](https://quantumfusion.dev/assets/dashloader/sponsors-new.png)\n\nDashLoader's performance is highly aided by the [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler) which helps us greatly with keeping standards high and load times low.\n\n## ![Donate](https://quantumfusion.dev/assets/dashloader/donate-new.png)\n\nIf you wish to support me and DashLoader's development you can do so by donating to my [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/notequalalpha).\n\n</center>\n",
