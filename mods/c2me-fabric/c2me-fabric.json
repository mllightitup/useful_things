    "body": "# Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric)\n\nA Fabric mod designed to improve the chunk performance of Minecraft.\n\n## So what is C2ME?\nC^2M-Engine, or C2ME for short, is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of chunk generation, I/O, and loading. This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.io/ishlandbukkit)\n\n## More information\nCheck out the README.md here: https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric\n",
