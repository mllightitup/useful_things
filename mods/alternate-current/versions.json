I do not foresee any major changes, meaning there might only be minor tweaks before a full 1.0 release!\n\n# 0.4.0\n- Added support for Minecraft 1.8 through [Legacy Fabric](https://legacyfabric.net/).\n- Redstone wires now avoid sending block updates to any other redstone wires. While this can halve the mspt in extreme cases, it can also lead to unresponsive behavior when a network is \"BUDded\" in an invalid state.\n- Block update order now more closely follows the shape update order. Wires now emit both shape and block updates when setting their power level (in v0.3 wires would emit block updates in reverse order after the power levels had been set). This should make it behave more intuitively.\n- Fixed errors/crashes when replacing large amounts of dust with the `/fill` command.",

Heavily inspired by [theosib's](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-420777) [RedstoneWireTurbo](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/src/main/java/carpet/helpers/RedstoneWireTurbo.java), the block update order depends on the way power flows through wire networks. \n\nThe `/alternatecurrent` command has been removed. This means the only way to disable the mod is to remove it from your mods folder.",
